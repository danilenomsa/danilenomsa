 Look after the best interest of both estate agents and their clients. Don’t let advertisers dictate or influence the experience of finding the right home or best agent.
 Listen to our clients. It's the only way to grow a business.
 Promote the best agents, not the biggest spenders. High online marketing costs is a pain for most agents, and the reality is that these costs are passed on indirectly to clients. We’d like to promote the agents who provide the best service, not the biggest spenders.
 Don’t be greedy. Keep costs low, fair and transparent. Stay humble and work in harmony with everyone involved in the property transaction.
 Promote the role and value of the estate agent. Through transparency, better communication and better tools. Weed out the bad apples through industry collaboration enforcing better standards and ethics.
